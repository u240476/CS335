/** This class will check if the dart thrown is a valid double, it will be used in the Finish class to check if the player has won by throwing a valid double. 
 * A valid double is any even number between 2 and 40, or 50 (the bullseye). 
 * If the player throws a valid double that brings their score to exactly 0, they win the game. 
 * If the player throws a valid double that brings their score below 0, it is considered a bust and their score resets to what it was at the start of their turn. 
 * If the player throws an invalid double, it is also considered a bust and their score resets to what it was at the start of their turn.
